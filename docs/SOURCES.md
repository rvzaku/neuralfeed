# NeuralFeed — Source Registry

This is the living registry of all sources. **Never delete a source** — set `enabled: false` with a note.

> **Updated 2026-06-15:** beyond the MVP table below, the live deployment also
> fetches **Hacker News**, **Hugging Face** (papers, models, spaces) and **YouTube**
> channels. Scheduling now runs via in-process **APScheduler** (not Celery beat),
> with a freshness bound so no source waits longer than `REFRESH_MAX_HOURS` between
> fetches. Per-source refresh intervals are clamped to that bound at runtime.

## Source Lifecycle Rules

1. **Adding**: must have a valid `access` method before going live
2. **Disabling**: set `enabled: false` with a note — never delete
3. **Quality review**: monthly for sources with signal_score < 0.3
4. **Full audit**: quarterly — prune stale or low-value sources

## RSS Feed URLs

## LinkedIn Stance (V4)

LinkedIn has no public API and scraping it at scale violates its ToS. NeuralFeed therefore
supports LinkedIn only as **curated manual follow targets**: `watched_accounts` rows with
`platform='linkedin'` whose cards link out to the person's public profile/activity page.
No automated LinkedIn fetching is implemented, deliberately.
